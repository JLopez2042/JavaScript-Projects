These are some small projects I made by using JavaScript.

## Projects

 <li> Tic-Tac-Toe Game </li>
  -The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first and then the users are off playing the classic game.
  Users can decide which token each player wants to use and the winner is celebrated with music.
